# pebble-watchface1
A unique and simple Pebble Time Round watchface.

Here's the story I wrote while developing this:

There's not much of a readme here. 

If you'd like to see it and don't have a Pebble, you can install the Pebble SDK, which has an emulator.

Download that here: https://developer.pebble.com/sdk/

Isn't that kind of cool? I think so. 

But then again, I'm the type of person that gets excited reading documentation and instruction manuals.
